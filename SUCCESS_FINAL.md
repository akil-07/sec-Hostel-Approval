## Status Check
1.  **Permissions:** ✅ Active (You confirmed this).
2.  **App Config:** ✅ Updated with your Script URL.
3.  **Code:** ✅ Updated to save to Firebase instantly + Backup to Drive.

## 🚀 How to Test
1.  **Refresh your App** (Browser).
2.  **Submit a Leave Request** with a letter/photo.
3.  **Check the App:** It should appear instantly in your history (loaded from Firebase).
4.  **Check your Google Sheet:** A new row should appear with a shorter, clickable **Drive Link** (e.g., `https://drive.google.com...`).

## ℹ️ Note on Storage
- **App:** Uses the image saved directly in the database (fast).
- **Excel:** Uses the Google Drive link (easy access for admins).
- **Firebase Storage:** NOT used (saving you money/hassle).

You are good to go!
